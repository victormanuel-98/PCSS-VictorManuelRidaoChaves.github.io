## Packages
@react-three/fiber | Core 3D library

## Notes
The application is a 3D portfolio.
We need to load a local texture: `/images/profile.jpeg` for the About section.
The API has endpoints for projects (GET) and messages (POST).
We will use GSAP for smooth camera flights between "islands" (sections).
